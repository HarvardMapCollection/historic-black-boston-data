The African School held classes in a room on the first floor of the meeting house from 1808 until 1835, when it moved into the new Abiel Smith School. Classes returned to the meeting house in 1849 when many African Americans chose to withdraw their children from the Smith School to protest segregated education.

National Parks Service.","In the early 1800s, a number of African Americans were attending the Bromfield Street Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1818, this church helped to establish a separate black Methodist church by hiring the Rev. Samuel Snowden. This church became known as the Revere Street Methodist Episcopal Church. They met at various locations until a building was purchased by the New England Methodist Conference on Revere (originally May) Street in 1823. This church moved in 1835 to a larger building on Revere Street. The Rev. Snowden, like the ministers who followed him, was actively engaged in antislavery activities. David Walker, antislavery advocate and author of the Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World and Expressly to the Coloured Citizens of the United States, was also a member of this church. The Revere Street Church building, which was owned by the Bromfield Street Church, was sold in 1903, and the Revere Street Church was left without a place to meet. They moved into a church in the South End in 1911 and again into another building in 1949. This church remains today on Columbus Avenue and is known as the Union United Methodist Church.",National Park Service,TBD

One was George Putman, who held meetings at his home, where he may have also hosted a gathering to discuss the founding of a college for African Americans, as Putnam valued education and advocated to integrate Bostonâ€™s schools. In 1853, Putnam sold the house to Robert Johnson, a freedom-seeker who escaped to Canada from Virginia, before settling in Boston in the 1830s. Based on his activism and associates, Johnson likely assisted freedom seekers; he served as a deacon at Twelfth Baptist Church, also known as the â€œFugitivesâ€™ Slaves Church.â€",https://buildingsofnewengland.com/tag/george-putnam/,changed

Both of the Hillards were opposed to slavery, and George was a law partner with Charles Sumner, an ardent abolitionist, until Sumner was elected to the U.S. Senate. By 1850, however, George began aligning with Daniel Websterâ€™s politics and believed that slavery should not come between the states. As a U.S. commissioner, George also had to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and issue arrest warrants to slave catchers (National Park Service). Despite her husbandâ€™s politics, Susan Hillard remained staunchly anti-slavery and even hid runaway slaves in the family home. ",Underground Railroad in Beacon Hill,same
