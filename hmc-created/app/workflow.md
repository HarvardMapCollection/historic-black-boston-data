3. If so, compare that location to what if any information is on the [1852 McIntyre map](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/ids:12216977).
4. Using [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org), locate the same address or area as the historic site on the base layer of Atlascope and Open Street Map. 
5. Right click and select Show Address.
6. Copy and paste the lat/long into the columns of pois.csv.
