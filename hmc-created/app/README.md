Historic data compiled by Grace Yeboah-Kodie and David Weimer.

menu-images.csv is mostly depracated images Grace compiled. Some can still be integrated into other files though.

menu-items.csv is the main level menu items for the different topics users can explore. Each menu item will generate its own map for users to explore.

method-images.csv are the image details from research materials to highlight when users click on any given point. We have prioritized iiif material, but some exceptions are saved as images in the image directory.

research-materials.csv are the primary sources (books, broadsides, newspaper, ephemera, etc) that the site can point users to to do research about points on the maps.

pois.csv is the list of point-wise data of people, places, events, publications, etc. Each point is (or will be) associated with a menu item, research material, and method image. Pois.csv location accuracy QA'd by Saraneh according to address listed in attribute table, and adjusted to best match the 1852 Mcintyre. QA is ongoing as more points will be added. Lat and Long fields for "changed" poi's need to be updated in attribute table because they were manually moved. (use field calculator?)

I haven't been able to develop a good set of location-based points for the Sarah Roberts case menu items. I also didn't get to the Shadrach Minkins material yet.
