National Parks Service.","In the early 1800s, a number of African Americans were attending the Bromfield Street Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1818, this church helped to establish a separate black Methodist church by hiring the Rev. Samuel Snowden. This church became known as the Revere Street Methodist Episcopal Church. They met at various locations until a building was purchased by the New England Methodist Conference on Revere (originally May) Street in 1823. This church moved in 1835 to a larger building on Revere Street. The Rev. Snowden, like the ministers who followed him, was actively engaged in antislavery activities. David Walker, antislavery advocate and author of the Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World and Expressly to the Coloured Citizens of the United States, was also a member of this church. The Revere Street Church building, which was owned by the Bromfield Street Church, was sold in 1903, and the Revere Street Church was left without a place to meet. They moved into a church in the South End in 1911 and again into another building in 1949. This church remains today on Columbus Avenue and is known as the Union United Methodist Church.",National Park Service,"Black congregants were given their own local pastor (Samuel Snowden) in 1818, and their own church on May Street in 1823, under the sponsorship of Bromfield, who built a larger facility on Revere Street in 1835 for the black congregation",,"8, 13"

As a U.S. commissioner, George also had to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and issue arrest warrants to slave catchers (National Park Service).
