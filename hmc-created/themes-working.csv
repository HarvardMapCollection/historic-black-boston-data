Notably, members of the Committee provided legal and other aid to George Latimer, Ellen and William Craft, Shadrach Minkins, Thomas Sims, and Anthony Burns.

Members coordinated with donors and Underground Railroad conductors to provide escapees with funds, shelter, medical attention, legal counsel, transportation, and sometimes weapons.

When the agent for the slaveholder requested a new warrant, the spectators—mostly African-American women—rioted in the courtroom and rescued Small and Bates.

The incident was one of several slave rescue efforts that took place in Boston. Controversy over the fate of George Latimer led to the passage of the 1843 Liberty Act, which prohibited the arrest of fugitive slaves in Massachusetts.

Burns was born enslaved in Stafford County, Virginia. As a young man, he became a Baptist and a ""slave preacher"" at the Falmouth Union Church in Falmouth, Virginia. He was frequently hired out by his master and learned to read and write in his various assignments. In 1853, he escaped from slavery and reached the free state of Boston, Massachusetts, where he started working.

The following year, he was captured under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and tried in court in Boston. The Fugitive Slave Act was despised and fiercely resisted in Boston, and Burns's case attracted national publicity, including large demonstrations, protests, attacks, and violence. Federal troops were used in the city to ensure Burns was transported without interference to a ship sailing to Virginia post-trial.

Burns was eventually ransomed from slavery, with his freedom purchased by Boston sympathizers. Afterward, he was educated at Oberlin Collegiate Institute and became a Baptist preacher.

His capture and trial in Boston, and transport back to Virginia, generated wide-scale public outrage in the North and, ultimately, increased opposition to slavery by Northerners.

Burns was born enslaved in Stafford County, Virginia. As a young man, he became a Baptist and a ""slave preacher"" at the Falmouth Union Church in Falmouth, Virginia. He was frequently hired out by his master and learned to read and write in his various assignments. In 1853, he escaped from slavery and reached the free state of Boston, Massachusetts, where he started working.

The following year, he was captured under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and tried in court in Boston. The Fugitive Slave Act was despised and fiercely resisted in Boston, and Burns's case attracted national publicity, including large demonstrations, protests, attacks, and violence. Federal troops were used in the city to ensure Burns was transported without interference to a ship sailing to Virginia post-trial.

Burns was eventually ransomed from slavery, with his freedom purchased by Boston sympathizers. Afterward, he was educated at Oberlin Collegiate Institute and became a Baptist preacher. He was called to a position in Upper Canada (Ontario), where an estimated 30,000 refugee African Americans, both enslaved and free, had fled to, to gain or retain their freedom. He lived and worked there until his death.",,,22,https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm,

Abolitionists featured them in public lectures to gain support in the struggle to end the institution.

As prominent fugitives, they were threatened by slave catchers in Boston after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, so the Crafts emigrated to England. They lived there for nearly two decades and raised five children. The Crafts lectured publicly about their escape and challenged the Confederacy during the American Civil War. In 1860 they published a written account, Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; Or, The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery. One of the most compelling of the many slave narratives published before the American Civil War, their book reached wide audiences in the United Kingdom and the United States.

During the 1840s and 1850s he played an integral part in the anti-slavery and civil-rights efforts in Boston. Born in Salem, Massachusetts in 1823, Morris was the grandson of an enslaved man, and both of his parents were involved in Black organizations in Salem in the early nineteenth century. While working in the home of John G. King as a teenager, Morris met the lawyer and abolitionist Ellis Gray Loring, who hired him as a copyist, and under whom he studied law. Morris was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1847, and would work on a number of cases defending the interests of Black people, including freed and fugitive enslaved people, in the courts. Early in his career, Morris worked alongside Charles Sumner to desegregate Boston schools in the case Roberts V. the City of Boston. Although Lemuel Shaw and the Supreme Judicial Court ruled against Roberts, Morris and others continued to work, leading to an 1855 state law banning segregated schools. Morris was an active abolitionist and worked to defend Black people from the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, both in the courtroom, such as in his defense of formerly enslaved people Anthony Burns and Shadrach Minkins, and outside of the court room, in his work with the Boston Vigilance Committee, an abolitionist group which worked in concert with the Underground Railroad to aid and protect fugitives from slavery. In the 1850s, Morris petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to charter an African-American militia, the Massasoit Guards, to protect Black residents from the Fugitive Slave Law, and to integrate the state’s militias by striking the word “white” from the militia law. Although the charter for the Massasoit Guards was never granted, the group served as a precursor to the 54th Massachusetts regiment.",https://cdm.bostonathenaeum.org/digital/collection/p16057coll56,,,,4

National Parks Service..",,"William Cooper Nell (December 16, 1816 – May 25, 1874) was an African-American abolitionist, journalist, publisher, author, and civil servant of Boston, Massachusetts, who worked for the integration of schools and public facilities in the state. Writing for abolitionist newspapers The Liberator and The North Star, he helped publicize the anti-slavery cause. He published the North Star from 1847 to 18xx, moving temporarily to Rochester, New York.

He also helped found the New England Freedom Association in the early 1840s, and later the Committee of Vigilance, to aid refugee slaves. The Committee of Vigilance supported resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which had increased penalties against even citizens in free states who aided refugee slaves.

Nell's short histories, Services of Colored Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812 (1851) and The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution (1855), were the first studies published about African Americans. He is noted as the first African American to serve in the federal civil service, where he worked in the post office.",Wikipedia,,,,

During the 1840s and 1850s he played an integral part in the anti-slavery and civil-rights efforts in Boston. Born in Salem, Massachusetts in 1823, Morris was the grandson of an enslaved man, and both of his parents were involved in Black organizations in Salem in the early nineteenth century. While working in the home of John G. King as a teenager, Morris met the lawyer and abolitionist Ellis Gray Loring, who hired him as a copyist, and under whom he studied law. Morris was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1847, and would work on a number of cases defending the interests of Black people, including freed and fugitive enslaved people, in the courts. Early in his career, Morris worked alongside Charles Sumner to desegregate Boston schools in the case Roberts V. the City of Boston. Although Lemuel Shaw and the Supreme Judicial Court ruled against Roberts, Morris and others continued to work, leading to an 1855 state law banning segregated schools. Morris was an active abolitionist and worked to defend Black people from the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, both in the courtroom, such as in his defense of formerly enslaved people Anthony Burns and Shadrach Minkins, and outside of the court room, in his work with the Boston Vigilance Committee, an abolitionist group which worked in concert with the Underground Railroad to aid and protect fugitives from slavery. In the 1850s, Morris petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to charter an African-American militia, the Massasoit Guards, to protect Black residents from the Fugitive Slave Law, and to integrate the state’s militias by striking the word “white” from the militia law. Although the charter for the Massasoit Guards was never granted, the group served as a precursor to the 54th Massachusetts regiment.",https://cdm.bostonathenaeum.org/digital/collection/p16057coll56,"Lived outside Boston, in Chelsea",,,4
