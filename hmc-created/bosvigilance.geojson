His capture and trial in Boston, and transport back to Virginia, generated wide-scale public outrage in the North and, ultimately, increased opposition to slavery by Northerners.\n\nBurns was born enslaved in Stafford County, Virginia. As a young man, he became a Baptist and a \"slave preacher\" at the Falmouth Union Church in Falmouth, Virginia. He was frequently hired out by his master and learned to read and write in his various assignments. In 1853, he escaped from slavery and reached the free state of Boston, Massachusetts, where he started working.\n\nThe following year, he was captured under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and tried in court in Boston. The Fugitive Slave Act was despised and fiercely resisted in Boston, and Burns's case attracted national publicity, including large demonstrations, protests, attacks, and violence. Federal troops were used in the city to ensure Burns was transported without interference to a ship sailing to Virginia post-trial.\n\nBurns was eventually ransomed from slavery, with his freedom purchased by Boston sympathizers. Afterward, he was educated at Oberlin Collegiate Institute and became a Baptist preacher. He was called to a position in Upper Canada (Ontario), where an estimated 30,000 refugee African Americans, both enslaved and free, had fled to, to gain or retain their freedom. He lived and worked there until his death.", "desc-src": null, "notes": null, "img-src": null, "img-title": null, "image": null, "img-landing-page": null, "r-1-type": "Archival Papers", "r-1-inst": "Massachusetts Historical Society", "r-1-title": "Theodore Parker Papers", "r-1-landing": "https:\/\/www.masshist.org\/collection-guides\/view\/fa0283", "r-2-type": "Archival Papers", "r-2-inst": "Massachusetts Historical Society", "r-2-title": "Dana Family Papers", "r-2-landing": "https:\/\/www.masshist.org\/collection-guides\/view\/fa0233", "r-3-type": null, "r-3-inst": null, "r-3-title": null, "r-3-landing": null, "r-4-type": null, "r-4-inst": null, "r-4-title": null, "r-4-landing": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -71.06076151, 42.35751188 ] } },

As a young man, he became a Baptist and a \"slave preacher\" at the Falmouth Union Church in Falmouth, Virginia. He was frequently hired out by his master and learned to read and write in his various assignments. In 1853, he escaped from slavery and reached the free state of Boston, Massachusetts, where he started working.\n\nThe following year, he was captured under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and tried in court in Boston. The Fugitive Slave Act was despised and fiercely resisted in Boston, and Burns's case attracted national publicity, including large demonstrations, protests, attacks, and violence. Federal troops were used in the city to ensure Burns was transported without interference to a ship sailing to Virginia post-trial.\n\nBurns was eventually ransomed from slavery, with his freedom purchased by Boston sympathizers. Afterward, he was educated at Oberlin Collegiate Institute and became a Baptist preacher. He was called to a position in Upper Canada (Ontario), where an estimated 30,000 refugee African Americans, both enslaved and free, had fled to, to gain or retain their freedom.

Abolitionists featured them in public lectures to gain support in the struggle to end the institution.\n\nAs prominent fugitives, they were threatened by slave catchers in Boston after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, so the Crafts emigrated to England. They lived there for nearly two decades and raised five children. The Crafts lectured publicly about their escape and challenged the Confederacy during the American Civil War. In 1860 they published a written account, Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; Or, The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery. One of the most compelling of the many slave narratives published before the American Civil War, their book reached wide audiences in the United Kingdom and the United States. After their return to the US in 1868, the Crafts opened an agricultural school for freedmen's children in Georgia. They worked at the school and its farm until 1890.
